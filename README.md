# INST326_Final_Project
Final Project Repository

# Purpose:
* QA.txt - A sample text file with questions and answers to them, the format specifically is necessary for the program to run
* QuizGame.py - The python file on which the program is stored and is run through a command line argument
* README.md - This file, which has the credits, and explanation about the program


# Instructions:
* Run the file from the command line, the only two arguments needed are QuizGame.py and the text file you plan on using for the quiz
* This program is a quiz game, we reccomend using it as a study guide by writing your own questions into the text file
* Think of it like Kahoot/Quizlet where you can test yourself on your knowledge, this project is also open source so you may tweak your version as you wish 


# Rules
* Do not use '.' for abbreviations, (i.e, use DC/dc instead of D.C/d.c)
* The answers are not case-senstive
